# META: The Idea Generator

META is a unique, handcrafted, hackable, retro, open source, Arduino-powered Motivational Electronic Text Advisor.

This code is designed to run in an Arduino-powered controller, driving a standard HD44780-based 16x2 character LCD, with two buttons: an idea generation button, and the menu button for switching between META's different generation modes.

When you press META's idea generation button, this code generates a unique idea, just for you. Here are a few examples:

- GPS-Enabled Programming Calculator for Babies
- Locally-Sourced Weight-Sensing Gypsum Dice
- Animatronic BPA-Free Desk for Cats
- Laser-Cut Hands-Free Aluminum Leggings for Moms
- Augmented Reality Solar-Powered Teak Sunglasses

This is just a tiny sampling of the over 300 million distinct ideas I've somehow managed to cram into this little box to surprise and delight you for many years—nay, decades—nay, *eons* to come.

If you're so inclined, you can even try the intangible, abstract, online version of META right now at [KickMETA.com](http://kickmeta.com).
